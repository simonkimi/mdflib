/** \brief Interface against an MDF writer object.
 *
 * The MDF writer purpose is to create MDF files. It simplifies the writing
 * into some steps.
 *
 * The first is to create type of writer. This is done by using the
 * MdfFactory::CreateMdfWriter() function.
 *
 * The next step is to call the Init() function with a filename with valid path.
 * The Init function will create the actual MDF file object and check if it
 * exist or not. If it exist, it reads in the existing file content so it can
 * be appended.
 *
 * The next step is to prepare the file for a new measurement. This is done
 * by creating the DG/CG/CN/CC blocks that defines the measurement. Note that
 * it is the last DG block that is the target.
 *
 * Next step is to call the InitMeasurement() function. This create a thread
 * that handle the queue of samples. The function also write the configuration
 * to the file and closes it.
 *
 * The user shall know starts adding samples to the queue by first setting
 * the current channel value to each channel and then call the SaveSample()
 * function for each channel group (CG). Note that no samples are saved to the
 * file yet. The max queue size is set to the pre-trig time, see PreTrigTime().
 *
 * At some point the user shall call the StartMeasurement() function. The
 * sample queue is now saved onto the file. The save rate is actually dependent
 * if CompressData() is enabled or not. If compression is used the data is
 * saved at the 4MB size or a 10 minute max. If not using compression, the
 * samples are saved each 10 second.
 *
 * The user shall now call StopMeasurement() which flush out the remaining
 * sample queue. After stopping the queue, the user may add some extra block
 * as event (EV) and attachment (AT) blocks.
 *
 * The FinalizeMeasurement() function. Stops the thread and write all
 * unwritten blocks to the file.
